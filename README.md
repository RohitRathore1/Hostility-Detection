# Hostility Detection 

In this work, we present a novel hostility detection dataset in
Hindi language. We collect and manually annotate âˆ¼ 8200
online posts. The annotated dataset covers four hostility dimensions: 
fake news, hate speech, offensive, and defamation posts, along with a 
non-hostile label. The hostile posts are also considered for multilabel 
tags due to a significant overlap among the hostile classes. We release 
this dataset as part of the CONSTRAINT-2021 shared task on hostile post 
detection.
